Alberti Cipher Disk


This program it's for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course

We use Alberti cipher disk to encode and decode text giving the basic rules:

A 24 lenght aphabet:
A B C D E F G I L M N O P Q R S T V X Z 1 2 3 4

and a mobil inner circle
a c e g k l n p r t v z & x y s o m q i h f d b

which rotates to a given position

not all letters are available, we need to replace them

H = FF
J = II
K = QQ
U = VV
W = XX 
Y = ZZ
